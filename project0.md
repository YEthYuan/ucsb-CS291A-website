# Project 0: Static Web Page

Build, deploy, and load test a static web page hosted on GitHub Pages.

This project will ensure that students can deploy and load test a simple web
page prior to working with more complicated web applications.

Static web pages are fast to serve, and are relatively trivial to scale. Anyone
with access to a free github account can deploy a static web site that can
scale to thousands of users without requring any knowledge of how such scaling
is accomplished.

## Learning Outcomes:

- Student can setup a git repository and use it for version control.
- Student can build and deploy a simple static web page.
- Student can measure average page load time.
- Student can measure server's rate limit.

## Questions To Answer:

- On average, how many requests can `ab` complete in 10 seconds with various
  power of two concurrency levels between 1 and 256?
- Why are there diminishing returns at higher concurrency levels?
- What's the performance difference when requesting HTTP and HTTPS?
- How can github respond so quickly?
- What is your site's "Time to Interactive" according to PageSpeed Insights?
